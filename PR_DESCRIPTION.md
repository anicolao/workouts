# MVP Design and Mockups

## User Prompt
Write an MVP_DESIGN.md that specifies the initial feature set for our strength training workout tracker. Use image generation to create mockups of what our workout tracker should look like adn define the user stories that we'll have in the MVP.

## User Comments
Three pieces of feedback:
#1 - we want to use multiple spreadsheets so that the user can easily distinguish between what they may edit and what's internal.
#2 - we really require screenshots. You'll need to succeed at using image generation to prouduce mockups.
#3 - we're not sure about the weekly heatmap. Maybe move the Analytics into the dashboard for key metrics.

> [!WARNING]
> Image generation service is currently unavailable (503 Capacity Exhausted). 
> Detailed text descriptions of the UI have been updated in `MVP_DESIGN.md` to reflect the new dashboard design. 
> The architecture has been updated to use `InternalEventLog` and `Exercise Catalog` spreadsheets.
