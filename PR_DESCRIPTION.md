# MVP Design Updates

## Description
This PR updates `MVP_DESIGN.md` to reflect the current state of the project and introduces a new workflow for workout programs.

## Key Changes
-   **Architecture**: Added "Program Selection" step before logging.
-   **User Stories**: Added stories for configuring and selecting programs.
-   **Data Schema**: Defined `Programs` sheet structure.
-   **UI Mockups**: detailed the Program Selection flow.

## Justification
The user requested these updates to align the design document with the current reality and to specify the new program selection feature.

## User Prompt
> Review all the markdown in this repository and particularly the recently completed exercise catalog design. Then update the MVP_DESIGN.md document to reflect the current reality. Then, what we'd actually like is for hte users to be choosing and following a workout program beofre they log their exercise, so that when they start a workout day it can pre-populate with the exercises that they are likely to log. Add these user stories in before the logging and refine the design to include this step.
