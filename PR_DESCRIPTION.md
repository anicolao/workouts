# Adopt 'food' Project Workflow

## User Prompt
I want to copy the style of development that we used for the food project. In particular, I want an almost carbon copy of the e2e process and the WORKFLOW.md process. Read food/WORKFLOW.md, replicate it, and add in the e2e guidelines and anything else you might need to develop this project in a similar style............ Then follow WORKFLOW.md to create a PR for that.

Let's fix the licence first, I missed that it said MIT, we want GPLv3, rewrite history to say that and use gh to set the licence on the repository.
