# Update App Icons and Favicon

## User Prompt
Let's attempt a new app icon design. A stylized glowing neon spreadsheet grid floating in void. The grid lines are electric cyan and hot pink. In the center of the grid, the cells light up to form the minimalist shape of a fork. Dark glassmorphism style, frosted glass background, soft cyberpunk glow, deep charcoal background, rounded corners, high fidelity, 8k.

Also generate a favicon based on this description. For now, just show me the assets, don't add them to the repository yet.

The core of the favicon one is closest. Let's aim for a layered effect in preparation for devices like the apple vision pro, where the icon is viewed head on instead of being at an angle, and avoid having the glass outline, but rather just have the neon floating in a black field.

This looks good but maybe the fork portion could be larger/more front and center and it'd be nice to get more visual consistency between teh favicon and the app icon.

I like the favicon one! Let's generate that in all sizes, and follow WORKFLOW.md to put that up for review.
