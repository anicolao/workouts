This is the beginnings of a food logging app. It's looking pretty good, but there are a fwe things missing:

- I'd like dates/times in the food log to use an ever-less-abbreviated format. Dates that are today can just have the time. Yesterday can say "Yesterday @ TIME". Dates that are within the last week can just have the day of the week "Monday @ TIME" for example. Dates that are before that should be "Mon, Jan X". Dates that are from prior years should say the year as well.

- I'd like to be taken to a food details screen if I tap on a log. I should there be either able to edit the log, reanalyze with the AI, or delete the log entry (which puts it in the trash from which it can be recovered).
