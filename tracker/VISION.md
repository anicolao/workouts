# Vision: Privacy-First, User-Owned Workout Tracking

We believe that your health data belongs to you. In an age of walled gardens and subscription fatigue, we are building a workout tracker that empowers users to own their progress, customize their experience, and maintain complete privacy.

## Core Philosophy

### 1. Your Data, Your Drive
All data is stored in your personal Google Drive and Google Sheets.
- **No external servers:** We don't see your data.
- **No lock-in:** Your data is just a spreadsheet. You can export it, analyze it with other tools, or share it as you please.
- **Portable:** Take your history with you, forever.

### 2. Radical Simplicity & Customization
Fitness is personal. Our tracker adapts to your routine, not the other way around.
- **Spreadsheet-backed configuration:** Define your exercises, metrics, and goals in a familiar spreadsheet format.
- **Flexible schema:** Track reps, weight, RPE, tempo, or any custom metric you care about.

### 3. Open Source & Community Driven
We are building in the open.
- **Transparency:** Audit the code, contribute features, and fix bugs.
- **Community:** Share spreadsheet templates, workout programs, and visualizations without sharing your personal data.

### 4. Progress over Perfection
The goal is consistency. The app focuses on reducing friction to logging and providing meaningful insights to keep you motivated.
- **Fast logging:** Minimal clicks to record a set.
- **Visual implementation:** See your progress at a glance.

## The Future
We envision a ecosystem where users can seamlessly switch between interfaces (mobile, web) while keeping a single source of truth in their Drive, enabling a lifetime of fitness tracking without fear of data loss or service shutdown.
